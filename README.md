# Calculator-on-Python
this is the typical basic project on any programming language, i guess jjj, so, this is my version of a calculator on python.


i wanna say some things.

first, the box that contain the operations of a calculator, is in horizontal so, I couldn't found a way for to put it vertical.
second, in this project i did the basic operations and some case, if you want you can continue.

Have a nice Day :)
